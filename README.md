# Managing my dotfiles
Use this repo to get back to the configuration of various programs you use on a new computer.

# Pre-requisites
- `git`
- `stow`

# Getting the dotfiles
Clone this repo to your home directory

`git clone git@github.com:RunAtTekky/dotfiles.git`

This will create a directory ~/dotfiles/ 

`cd dotfiles/`

Now we use stow to get whatever config we want

`stow nvim`

This will set the config for your NeoVim
