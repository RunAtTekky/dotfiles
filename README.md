# My dotfiles for MacOS
On my [main](https://github.com/RunAtTekky/dotfiles) setup I use [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/)

Earlier I used [Linux Mint](https://github.com/RunAtTekky/dotfiles/tree/mint)

[Here](https://github.com/RunAtTekky/dotfiles/tree/macos) on my MacOS setup I want similar keyboard driven workflow.
